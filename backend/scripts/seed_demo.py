"""
Seed a clean demo dataset for the Websoft Service ERP Solution
Service Operations core slice.

Run with: uv run python scripts/seed_demo.py

Sets up:
- Company: Webmaster Consultancy Pte Ltd
- Module catalog + per-company module enablement (Module Control /
  licensing) -- Service Operations core modules enabled, everything
  else (including Commission Management and Integrations/Odoo
  migration, deferred for now) left disabled.
- Users: Dennis (owner), Nico (service_lead), Cherish (sales_manager),
  Wei Ling (support_engineer) -- all password "demo1234"
- Group Authority: default Groups (Owner / Admin, Service Team, Sales
  Team, Finance Team) with a per-module access matrix, and each seeded
  user assigned to the appropriate Group. Dennis's OWNER role already
  grants him FULL access everywhere regardless of group (see
  app/services/authority.py); he is still put in "Owner / Admin" so
  Staff Master doesn't show him as ungrouped. Nico and Wei Ling both
  land in "Service Team" -- the group grants them broad Service
  Operations/Contracts access, but the SRV-004/SRV-011 named-person
  rule (Nico, or Cherish as backup, decides excess usage) is enforced
  separately by role, not by group, so Wei Ling still can't approve a
  Service Record or decide excess usage despite sharing Nico's group.
- Customer: Acme Manufacturing Pte Ltd
- One Active 10-hour contract (SGD 3,000), already invoiced annually
- A job order with Service Records already approved, deliberately left
  just short of exhausting the contract, PLUS one final SUBMITTED
  (not yet approved) record that will push it into Excess Usage --
  left pending on purpose so a live walkthrough can approve it and
  perform the Nico excess-usage review itself, rather than the seed
  script doing it upfront.
