"""
Accounts Payable business logic.

- PUR-001: a purchase order below the company's approval threshold is
  approved by procurement/finance; above it, the owner approves. The
  threshold is undecided (open item 4.4), so while it is unset EVERY
  purchase order goes to the owner.
- PUR-002: 2-way matching. A supplier invoice is compared to its
  purchase order and nothing else -- there is no goods receipt.
- PUR-003: a bill that matches its PO is auto-approved for payment.
  A mismatch is recorded as an EXCEPTION with the discrepancy spelled
  out, and stops there: how mismatches get resolved is open item 4.5,
  so this deliberately does not decide it.
