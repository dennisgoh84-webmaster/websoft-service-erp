"""
Billing business logic -- BILL-001 (annual upfront), BILL-002 (no
approval needed), BILL-005 (revenue recognized on invoice), and SRV-008
(excess usage billed at the contract's own blended rate).

Every invoice raised here is a tax invoice: GST is applied per the
company's tax code (confirmed standard-rated), it is serially numbered,
and its due date comes from the customer's own payment terms (confirmed
2026-09-10: terms vary per customer). A customer with no agreed terms
gets no due date rather than an invented one.
