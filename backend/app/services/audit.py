"""
Central audit logging helper -- every module writes through here rather
than each inventing its own logging, per the architecture in
docs/system-architecture.md (Audit logging section). This is the data
source for the Event Logs module (app/routers/event_logs.py).

Request-scoped context (who + which browser/device made the call) is
captured once per request by the middleware in app/main.py and read
back here via a contextvar, so callers don't need to thread a FastAPI
`Request` through every service function just to log an action -- they
only need to know *what* happened (entity, action, old/new values).
