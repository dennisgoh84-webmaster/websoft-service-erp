"""
Core / Administration models: Company, User, and the central Audit Log.

RBAC is split across two independent axes (confirmed with Dennis,
2026-09-10 -- resolves open item 8.4):
- `User.role` is a small fixed enum used ONLY for the specific
  named-responsibility rules already confirmed in the business rules
  (e.g. SRV-004/SRV-011: Nico, or Cherish as backup, decides excess
  usage; Dennis as owner). It does not drive general module access.
- Group Authority (see app/models/groups.py) drives general per-module
  security: what a user can see/do in each module, at None/View/Edit/
  Full granularity, controlled by which Group they belong to. The group
  assignment lives on `UserCompanyAccess`, not on the user: exactly one
  Group **per company** the user works in (confirmed 2026-09-10), since
  Groups are themselves company-scoped.
