"""Job Orders (formerly "Helpdesk Tickets") -- Service Operations models.

SLA targets are explicitly deferred (SRV-009) -- priority is tracked but
no automatic response/resolution time target is computed from it.
Instead, confirmed 2026-09-10: `due_date` is a manual field, set by
whoever opens the Job Order (Sales staff or a Coordinator) after
discussion with the Support department -- not derived from priority or
any fixed SLA window. It is optional; a Job Order with no due date set
is simply not counted as due/overdue anywhere.

Status model reworked 2026-09-11: there is no manual "Resolved" step
any more. A Job Order auto-closes when its most recently submitted
Service Record is both Approved and marked Completed ('C', not
Uncompleted 'U') -- see app/services/service_records.py
maybe_auto_close_job_order(). CLOSED replaced the old manual
Resolve->Close two-step; VOID is new, a manual dead-end for a Job Order
that should never have been raised (duplicate, raised in error),
separate from a normal completed job.

Job Order Type added 2026-09-12: SUPPORT (default, ad-hoc support work)
or PROJECT (project-type work with a scheduled milestone template --
installation, training, repeat training, handover, completion sign-off).
PROJECT type Job Orders carry a project_milestones child table for
Gantt chart rendering on the frontend.
